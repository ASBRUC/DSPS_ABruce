Part 0: Old Plot.
Here are my original plots from HW8 - HiggsBosonSearch

Part 1: Redoing a plot. 
I redid a plot from HW8, the confusion matrixes. They are here below. <img width="600" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5677c110-6caa-4f16-9641-a24bd0a821fa" />

I changed the color scheme from bones (a black to white gradient) to blues. I think the blues help with the text overlayed in each block since the text is either black or white.
I also think that the blue gradient is a bit easier to see vs different shades of gray on a black background for reasons such as the black/white notebook background as well as brightness of computer might contributing.

Part 2: bad plot/good plot
On the top is my bad plot and on the bottom is the good plot. 
Both are from this paper from nature: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02666-9#Sec6. 
The paper looks at wavelengths to determine areas of temperature on an exoplanet. 
The bad plot shows 25 different areas with a color map. Although I think this is a good use of small multiples in the idea I think the color gradient they gave turns it into a less than ideal visual. 
Because the gradient is taking in two factors, it is not completely obvious what is causing the color change. 
I believe separating these color maps into different plots would help. The good graph on the right efficiently shows a lot of information on one plot. 
The different colors as well as the grouped wavelength axis help the reader understand why we are looking at these wavelengths specifically. 
I would only recommend to use a different color than the bright yellow on the white background.
