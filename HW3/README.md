HW 3 completed by Alex Bruce with Zoe Beris.

In HW3 mboltzmanndistribution, I used data from the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way Galaxy to plot their Rotational Curves (radius v. velocity)
The Rotational Curve can be used to identify the movement of stars as well as the existance of dark matter.
In this assignment I also compared the different error values standard vs total, in means of visual plotting.

In earthquakes, we first cleaned our data by changing the time from standard time to time difference.
After removing large values in our time difference data, we were ready to do data analysis.
