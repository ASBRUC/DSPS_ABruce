HW 2 completed by Alex Bruce with Zoe Beris, TJ Tomaszeski, and Katie Moses.

Breakdown of Work:
Zoe Beris - Data visualization, plotting parameters, labeling.
Katie Moses - Postieror function concepts.
Alex Bruce - Support and distributions generation.
TJ - Descriptions/analysis of figures.

In HW2 I genered four different distrubtions consisting of standard normal and student_t using the scipy package.
By comparing the graphs I found that the student_t distribution has heavier (taller) tails than the standard normal, which can increase correlation in some cases (like bayesian).
I also practiced probability nomenclature as well as reviewing how to use the Baye's theorem.
