Alex Bruce's homework/projects for Data Science for Physical Scientists.

I decided to take this class to learn more about Data Science in a field I am familiar in. This semester I started my masters in Data Science and I hope to learn about different techniques for analysis, and how/when to apply them. Breaking down complex topics into understandable steps is something I believe I am good as wellas practiced in my Physics undergrad.
