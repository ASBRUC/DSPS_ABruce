HW 10 - completed by Alex Bruce.

In this assignment I practiced computing a CNN for an image of my choosing. This involved modifying the original image and choosing and looking at multiple layers as well as interpreting the results.

I also praticed using the Keras (tensorflow) library for Neural Networks with a basic dataset. Comparing and computing the results for a CNN vs a non-convoluted neural network.
